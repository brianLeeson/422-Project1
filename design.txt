project design

simple python(?) GUI. user preferences: weights, group size, etc
use google surveys to collect information from users. download results into a csv file
import and parse csv files and create student instances
group class has-a student.
apply some function to sort all students.
display sorted groups
allow user to move people from group to group. also to change settings and resort


how do we allow the end user to change survey questions? all Q'a after x are questions on a scale?

here's the core
gui: set weights, import csv, sorts, (changing weights, changing groups?)

risk: what if google forms doesn't do what we want it do to. GUI or algorithm could be a lot more work.

devide up the project. who does what
Amie: algorith

Brian: GUI

Jamie: Forms/Input
